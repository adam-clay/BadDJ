
Spotify Music sharing space, being able to log in through 3rd party Spotify. Every person on this platform will have some playlist that represents them on their profile, and the app would be able to suggest songs and other users with similar preferences to them. People can also create conversations (like tweets with a song/playlist/artist attached) to communicate with other users about interests. One API we will use is the Spotify API https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/ to get information about a person's genre/artist preferences to curate appropriate user playlists, and we will use the last.fm API https://www.last.fm/api to gather data about popular artists as it applies to people in general. The two APIs will work together inorder to understand general trends in music taste, as well as personal (single user) preferences.
